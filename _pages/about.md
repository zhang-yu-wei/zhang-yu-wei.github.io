Hi, welcome to my homepage! I am a PhD student in [Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute (HDSI), UCSD](https://www.ece.ucsd.edu/) advised by [Prof. Jingbo Shang](https://shangjingbo1226.github.io/). Before that, I received my B.S. in Physics from Nankai University and M.S. in E.E. from UCSD. Please check my cv [here](https://zhang-yu-wei.github.io/files/cv.pdf).

Research Interest
======

My most recent research focus include:
    1. [[Enabling]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04624) and [[evaluating]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.10813.pdf) LLMs with long-term memories
    2. Facilitating Retrieval-augmented Generation to handle complex (implicit or [[multi-hop]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14831) or [[compositional]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14739)) queries
    3. Other areas such as alignment, [[multi-modal]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.05068.pdf) and efficiency
Beyond that, I have broad research interest in Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing and Vision-Language Learning. Currently, I am working on improving embedding models, information extraction from large amount of data and their collaborations with large language models (LLMs).
